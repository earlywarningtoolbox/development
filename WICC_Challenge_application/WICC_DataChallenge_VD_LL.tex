\section{In a nutshell} %Overview

Critical transitions have been identified in seemingly disparate systems ranging from ecology and climate to medicine and finance (Scheffer et al. 2001; Scheffer 2009). %Global finance occasionally suffers from market crashes (May et al. 2008), while asthma attacks (Venegas et al. 2005) and epileptic seizures (McSharry et al. 2003) are examples of sudden medical systemic failures. Abrupt shifts in ocean circulation have occurred in the past climate (Rahmstorf 2002) and may be triggered again under present trends of global environmental conditions (Lenton et al. 2008).
Acknowledging the existence of such critical transitions is only the first step towards predictions and taking advantage of such knowledge. Being able to quantify the probability of an approaching critical transition would be of unperceived value, but efficient tools to foresee upcoming transitions have been lacking. Unfortunately, for most systems, we neither have sufficient records of past transitions nor reliable models to study their behavior, which are the prerequisite for traditional prediction approaches. Nonetheless, recent work has proposed an alternative, more generic way of approaching the prediction challenge: instead of constructing case-specific models or indicators it is possible to assess the proximity to a critical transition by measuring the overall resilience, or other generic indicators, of a system as suggested by complex systems theory on \textit{\textbf{generic early-warning signals}} for critical transitions (Scheffer et al. 2009).\\

Here, we present our newly developed \textbf{Early Warning Signal Toolbox} designed for the \textbf{estimation} and \textbf{visualization} of fingerprints of upcoming critical transitions based on time series data. Our toolbox is characterized by three unique features: \textit{\textbf{First}}, it is of truly generic nature and can be applied to any system that may undergo critical transitions. \textit{\textbf{Second}}, it is based on state-of-the-art methodology from recent high profile publications and has already been tested in real world cases (refs). \textit{\textbf{Third}}, it is easy to use and available under a widely-used open access statistical program (R Project for Statistical Computing\footnote{http://www.r-project.org}). In the following we provide an intuitive description of the underlying theory, demonstrate the usage of the toolbox, and propose broader implications for the understanding and management of critical transitions in complex dynamical systems.


\section{The Early Warning Signals - Theoretical background} 

\subsection{Why should we expect Early Warnings before Critical Transitions?}
{\bf [IT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT TO HAVE THE BALL-VALLEY EXPLANATION only IN FIGURE CAPTION? NOW THE SAME DESCRIPTION IS duplicated IN THE TEXT AND CAPTION, ONE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT(?) BUT ALSO THE CURRENT VERSION WORKS NICELY]}
A simple way to understand why we should expect early warnings before critical transitions is to think of the behavior of a system as the motion of a ball in a landscape of valleys and hilltops (Fig. 1 a). Balls represent the state of the system, and valleys correspond to the basins of attraction of alternative stable states. The width and the steepness of the basin of attraction determine the capacity of the system to absorb a perturbation without shifting to an alternative state, and reflects the resilience of the state of the system. As conditions bring the system close to a critical transition (Fig. 1b), the basin of attraction of the current state of the system shrinks and so does its resilience: even a tiny perturbation is enough to shift the sphere to the alternative valley. At the same time, the steepness of the basin of attraction becomes lower: this means that the same perturbation that may not tip the system, it will definitely take longer to dissipate due to the phenomenon of \textit{\textbf{critical slowing down}} (Fig. 1 b). \textit{Mathematically}, critical slowing down is connected to vanishing dominant eigenvalue of the system at equilibrium and close to the critical transition; this has been proven to be a universal phenomenon preceding critical transitions  (Wissel 1984; Strogatz 1994). \textit{Practically}, critical slowing down enables us to probe the dynamics of the system in order to assess its resilience and the risk of an upcoming transition. An increasing time required by a system to recover from a perturbation can serve as early-warning signal of an approaching tipping point (van Nes \& Scheffer 2007; Fig. 1 a1, b1).

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure1.eps}
\caption{Early-warnings in the dynamics of a system as it approaches a critical transition. Far from the transition resilience is high (a): the system lies in a broad and steep basin of attraction. Small disturbances are damped by high recovery rates back to equilibrium. As a result the time to recover from perturbations is short (a1), the dynamics are characterized by low correlation between subsequent states (a2), low variance (a3), and low skewness (a4). Close to transition resilience is low (b): the system lies in a narrow and flat basin of attraction. Small disturbances are not effectively damped due to critical slowing down. As a result the time to recover from perturbations is short (b1), the dynamics are characterized by high correlation (b2), high variance (b3), and high skewness (b4).}

\end{figure}

\subsection{What are Early Warning Signals?}
{\bf GENERAL comment: PERHAPS THE DESCRIPTIONS COULD BE SHORTENED A LITTLE MORE?}
While an increase in recovery time after a disturbance is the most direct indicator of the vicinity to a tipping point, for most natural systems it will be very difficult to measure this systematically. Take for instance the impossibility of conducting a perturbation experiment for measuring the resilience of the thermohaline circulation. The fact, however, that all systems are permanently subjected to natural perturbations allows us to identify approaching tipping points indirectly through characteristic indicators. First, slowing down leads to an \textit{\textbf{increase in autocorrelation}} (Ives 1995; Held \& Kleinen 2004): the state of the system resembles its previous state when it is close to a tipping point (Fig. 1 a2, b2). The resulting increase in `memory' of the system can be measured in the frequency spectrum of the system by simply looking at lag-1 autocorrelation in the pattern of fluctuations (Held \& Kleinen 2004). Second, there is an \textit{\textbf{increase in variance}} (Van Nes \& Scheffer 2003; Carpenter \& Brock 2006) prior to a tipping point: the state of the system will fluctuate more widely around its equilibrium. As perturbations accumulate and are not damped down sufficiently fast due to critical slowing down, the variance in the state of the system will increase (Fig. 1 a3, b3). Also, the basin of attraction may become asymmetric close to a transition (Scheffer et al. 2009) (Fig. 1 a, b). Such asymmetry causes the state of the system to spend more time in the flatter part of the attraction basin. This leads to \textit{\textbf{increasing skewness}} (Guttal \& Jayaprakash 2008) in the distribution of the monitored system state before a transition (Fig. 1 a4, b4).

\section{The Early Warning Signals Toolbox - Application}
\subsection{General characteristics}
The Early Warning Signals Toolbox is designed to \textbf{estimate} and \textbf{visualize} a series of \textbf{14 characteristic indicators} that reflect the effects of critical slowing down on the system prior to a critical transition (Table 1). In particular, the toolbox:
\begin{itemize}
\item operates on time series collected by monitoring the state of a system that might undergo a critical transition. No other information than a time series is required. 
\item is generic and applicable to a wide variety of data sources, including temperature data, nutrient concentrations, microbial biomass, brain activity, stock marker indices or similar.
\item is applicable to both real world observations as well as simulations derived from models that are, for instance, developed to understand climatic transitions, ecological shifts or social collapses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{An example}
Consider a time series that represents a resource that due to increased harvesting is facing the risk of reaching a point of no return at which resource biomass tips to overexploitation (Fig. 2a). Typically, the managing institution of that resource (be it grazing grounds, or fish stocks) has been monitoring the resource prior to the regime shift (Fig. 2 green part - upper left panel). Even if the manager is aware of the changes in the driving harvesting pressure and the slightly declining resource biomass, it may be difficult to assess the resilience of the system, and hence proximity of a tipping point, in order to take action. Imagine now, though, that the manager runs the \textbf{\textit{Early Warning Signal Toolbox}} online on a personal computer to quantify the resilience and the risk of approaching a tipping point. The manager can find out that after removing the slow declining trend in mean biomass (red line in Fig. 2Ai), the model residuals (Fig. 2Aii) show a rise in autocorrelation and variance (Fig. 2Aiii,iv). Sensitivity analysis to the parameters of the time series analysis do not change the result: different parameter choices give positive trends in autocorrelation and variance (Fig. 2B). The system indeed seems to be close to tipping, as the resilience is low. Is it also possible to investigate whether an alternative attractor has already appeared, but potential analysis does not indicate this in our example case (Fig. 2C). Still the resource is riding the current stable state. Perhaps there is a chance to control the driver and avoid further undermining of the resilience.

\end{figure}

One example of the toolbox capabilities is \textbf{Quick Detection Analysis (QDA)}, which estimates the flagship indicators for the detection of critical transitions. For the full functionality listing, see [\ref{sec:resources}].\\
 
\textbf{QDA} performs three operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Indicator trend analysis} of autocorrelation and variance along a time series based on sliding windows. The user can optionally log-transform or interpolate data (eg. if there are missing values or the data are unevenly spaced) (Fig. 2, Box 1), as well as filter the data using smooth, linear, or first-difference detrending from a drop-down menu (Fig. 2, Box 2). It is also possible to select the size of the sliding window (defined as a fraction of the time series length) (Fig. 2 upper panel, Box 3).
\item \textbf{Trend sensitivity analysis} of autocorrelation and variance. Two scroll bars allow the user to choose the steps for incrementally changing the size of the sliding window and the bandwidth for the smoothing in order to {\bf [SOMETHING MISSING HERE?]} (Fig. 2 middle panel, Box 4, 5). 
\item \textbf{Potential analysis} provides tools to reconstruct a potential landscape of the system states, which helps to identify alternative attractors from the data - a low cutoff increases the chance of recognizing alternative attractors but also makes the analysis more sensitive to stochastic variation (Fig. 2 lower panel, Box 6).
\end{enumerate}

For a real-world example, select \textit{real climate data} from the drop-down menu, follow the parameters in Figure 3, and try to detect the exit from the Younger Dryas around 11,500 ago yourself! {\bf WHAT IS YOUNGER DRYAS?}

\section{Potential impact and future perspectives}
The earlywarnings toolbox presents a state-of-the-art approach for detecting generic warning signals indicating critical transitions in time series for a wide range of systems. It is flexible and easy-to-use, open source, and can take advantage of the latest community-based computing philosophies. Based on a solid theoretical background and given the increasing availability of time series monitoring data (e.g. from tweets or remote sensing data), the toolbox can provide a new perspective for anticipating and managing transitions in cases as diverse as fisheries, ocean circulation patterns, migraine attacks, psychological disorders, or social transformations.
